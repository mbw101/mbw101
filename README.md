### 👋🏽 Hi, my name is Malcolm

🎓 Computer Science student at the University of Guelph and expected to graduate in April 2024

📚 Throughout my time in school, I've previously interned at Microsoft and Tulip as a Software Engineer, and I am currently interning at Wealthsimple this semester on the Options Platform team. At Microsoft, I was on the Media Transformation and Analysis (MeTA) team within OneDrive/SharePoint where I investigated and implemented the usage of a dockerized reverse proxy for their monolith API

💻 Passionate about learning & tech. Eager to grow and learn whenever possible

💪🏽 In my free time, I love working out, learning martial arts, and playing basketball
